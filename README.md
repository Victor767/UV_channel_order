# UV_channel_order

The addon allows to manipulate the order of UV channels in UV Maps list by adding two new buttons "Move UV Up" and "Move UV Down" underneath the list. Changing the order is performed by selecting UV channel you need to move up or down and pressing either "Move UV Up" or "Move UV Down" button under the list.
